Hello! I am Swati Nair and currently in the midst of exploring the world of open source (and trying to be a part of it!), distributed systems, and Kubernetes. In my spare time, I like to watch Netflix, read, travel, or dance.

I currently work as a backend developer at IBM, which lets me dabble with Node.js, Golang, and Kubernetes. I completed my Master's program in Computer Science from University at Buffalo in the month of December 2018. Before joining the Master's program, I was working as a software test engineer, initially at Amdocs (2012-16) and later, with Capgemini (2016-17).

I love to teach and mentor. I am grateful that I got multiple opportunities to explore this avenue by being part of a non-profit organization, [MentorTogether][mentortogether], where I mentored a ninth-grade girl on English and mathematics courses. Other experiences include teaching C, data structures, and algorithms to around 50 students after my senior year and being a guest lecturer at my undergrad college for a session on "Java programming".

This website is an attempt to follow my passion of knowledge sharing. Here, I will be covering basic technical stuff and interesting reads, let it be research papers, open source contributions, apps I develop, and the nitty-gritty computer science concepts that we learned during our school time, but don't remember it now (Yeah! It happens). Along with it, I might also share random thoughts that pop up in my mind palace and life experiences that are worth sharing!
